# The enchanted cottage
This particular enchanted object is right out of the storybooks. Deep in the forest is a small cottage owned by a timeless couple, Hans and Matilda who are doomed never to meet. When it is wet he goes outside but when it is dry she must leave the house.

Their house may look traditional but is full of state of the art electronics. Thanks to their Arduino Yun they can receive their weather reports from the internet. And rather than their motion being powered by catgut they are now servo assisted. The inside of their house is lit with a colour changing LED which shows that the power is on and if the internet connection is operational. Their thermometer also has had an upgrade and now displays the inside temperature with an LED bar-graph picking up the temperature via a thermistor, a press of a button shows the temperature as reported from the internet.
